        <p id ="infocontent">In an era when the Napoleonic Wars were at their peak, a fierce air war of dragons begins!

            A fantasy novel about the events that take place in the early 19th century during the Napoleonic Wars when airmen from different countries, consisting of dragons and aviators, entered the war. Based on the hypothesis, "What would have happened if there was an air force consisting of dragons and aviators in the Napoleonic era?" the novel begins in January 1805 when the Royal Navy's Reliant captured a small French destroyer carrying dragon eggs on the verge of hatching.
            
            From the Atlantic to Lake Lagan in Scotland, from the Battle of Trafalgar to the Battle of Dover. In the early 19th century, each country's flying squadron of fire and mountain-breathing dragons colored the skies of Europe. The dragon Temerre, a breed that only the emperor can possess, with elegance and wisdom, a great friendship shared by Colonel Lawrence, who was destined to become his aviator, and a touching adventure unfolds.</p>
