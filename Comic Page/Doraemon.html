        <p id ="infocontent">Novita, an ordinary elementary school student who is only good at napping, shooting, and knitting. Then one Lunar New Year, Novita's desk drawer opens, where Doraemon, a cat-type robot from the future, and Novi Sewashi, Novita's grandchild, appear. According to Janggu's story, Novita was still unhappy as an adult and could not get a job, so he ran a company, but even that went bankrupt, causing huge debts, which made it difficult for the remaining descendants.

            After that, Doraemon and Novita literally become best friends. If you tell Doraemon about Novita's difficulties and necessity, it magically fulfills Novita's various dreams and aspirations with a "secret tool" taken out of a four-dimensional pocket in the abdomen. Novita learns and reflects on tools with Shizuka, who is liked by his neighborhood friends, Novita, who is cowardly and bad, but is a soft Sneo and alley leader, but the inside is good Zion, and in the process, Novita's future changes little by little.</p>
